      <div class="text">This is Yuxuan Jia, and my English name is Isaac. I come from China, one of the four ancient civilizations, where Chinese characters, the Chinese zodiac, traditional festivals, traditional food, and drink such as tea, dumplings, hot pot, etc., are all part of the Chinese culture. I was born on the 10th of December 2002, which means I am 19 years old; however, I have lived in Australia for over four years. I left China in Year 8 to study in Australia, leaving behind my familiar Mandarin and learning how to speak English. However, both in China and Australia, I could not live without my pets, so in my daily life, I love playing with my cats, talking to them, and having my Python lying on me for petting. Yes, my ragdoll cat in Melbourne is called Python because I have always believed that Python is the best language in the world, and therefore, Python is the best cat in the world for me.</div>

        <span>Interest in IT</span>
      </div>
      <div class="text">First of all, my interest in IT comes mostly from my family. My father is a programmer, and there are all kinds of programming books at home. However, in the beginning, MY interest in IT was that I could use my father's computer to play all sorts of games. However, when I was nine years old, I began to think about whether I could also make my own games. My father gave me great support and taught me Java in his free time. In the beginning, I thought learning programming was tedious, but as time went by, I gradually understood that IT is not just programming but a broader world, so my IT dream became stronger and stronger.
Furthermore, RMIT is the only Australian university I knew when I was in China, and it has always been my goal.  There are three reasons. First, RMIT enjoys a good reputation and a proud academic ranking worldwide. I believe that I can master IT well by studying at RMIT.  Secondly, the teaching building of RMIT is impressive both in style and layout. It is very advanced, beautiful and fashionable and has won many awards.  Third, RMIT has a high post-graduation employment rate, and employers worldwide who have hated RMIT recognize its value.
Finally, through my study, I hope to have a better understanding and in-depth knowledge of IT, and at the same time carry out more practical operations and master IT proficiently. I can actively face all kinds of difficulties in my learning career, never give up easily, and devote myself to the magical world of IT. In a word, I hope to achieve my future goals by learning IT

As a person high in Conscientiousness, I am very good at delaying gratification and resisting impulses in favor of your long-term plans. I am highly controlled and disciplined, and nearly always finish what I start.
As a highly Extraverted person, I am enthusiastic about life and what it has to offer. I see the world as full of potential joys and thrills, and I am eager to pursue them.
As a person who is high in Agreeableness, I prioritize others’ own needs and interests. I do not frequently empathize with myself and tend not to feel a lot of concern about my needs.
As a person who is low in Neuroticism, I experience less negative emotion than the average person. I rarely feel anxious, sad, or self-conscious, and am not troubled much by negative thoughts.

          <div class="text2">All in all, these test results represent a microcosm of my 19 years of life.   Behind the answers are decisions made in my life.   There is no right or wrong.   What impressed me most was that I could find my own satisfaction in the process of helping others, which enabled me to act as an altruist in the team.   I would often ask my members whether my ideas were contrary to their ideas and work together to achieve the same goal.   At the same time, I have enough creativity and enthusiasm.   As long as I have the opportunity to cooperate with others, members of the team may soon become friends who can talk about everything.   Therefore, when I build a team, I think about finding people who are not similar to my test results, so that I can blend in with each other without becoming too much of a conflict.

          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <span class="title2">Motivation</span>
          <div class="text2">According to statistics, in 2021, nearly 35% of Australian adults are overweight, and more than 30% are obese, which is quite a scary number.   Because of the closure of gyms during the COVID-19 lockdown, coupled with snacking and home inactivity, more and more people are ignoring the potential problems of obesity.   It is important for every Australian to be aware of the dangers of obesity and overweight.   Weight loss insurance can provide targets for obese or overweight Australians, thus solving the problem of the high proportion of obese Australians.
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <span class="title2">Description</span>
          <div class="text2">The specific service of weight loss insurance is divided into the following points:
          </div>
          <div class="text2">1. Customize a personal weight-loss plan for users according to a series of information such as for overweight or obesity, gender, and how much time they have for losing weight every day.   The plan that reduces weight insurance wants to accomplish reasonably, want the person that reduces weight to pay effort to be able to achieve a goal certainly only. Flexible, for different parts of the fat, has different action recommendations. Nutrition, weight loss is not by diet, but recommended to users’ low calorie but nutritious food, while avoiding any allergies.
          </div>
          <div class="text2">2. Weight loss insurance is not only an insurance software but more like a forum for dieters. Dieters will share their weight loss experience in the forum for everyone to exchange.   In addition, there are many professional weight-loss coaches and fitness coaches who often post in weight-loss insurance, or help users answer questions in real-time, and so on.   At the same time, users will have a free one-on-one video class with a weight-loss coach once a week, during which the coach will help and coach users whether the exercise they do is standard.
          </div>
           <div class="text2">3. Weight loss insurance will pass the scale real-time observed dieters weight changes, the user needs to wear in daily life with smartwatches, its function is to detect the user daily movement trajectory and AI algorithm is used to determine the user fairness and healthy to lose fat, once found that users take illegal way to lose weight like liposuction or a false behavior such as insurance fraud, Weight-loss insurance will ban its account. Weight-loss insurance offers rewards, but the real focus is on maintaining a healthy body.
          </div>
           <div class="text2">4. The time limits are given to people who are overweight or obese vary, from six months for mildly obese people to more than a year for moderately obese people to more than two years for severely obese people.   Insurance reducing weight believes fat is not temporary form, so reducing weight needs to rely on reasonable, safe, long-term means to undertake, cannot impatient, otherwise will be counterproductive.
          </div>
           <div class="text2">5. Weight Loss Insurance has long-term cooperation with most gyms and fitness centers in Australia. Users can search nearby fitness places in the weight loss insurance app to quickly find fitness centers cooperating with weight loss insurance and enter them freely for free.
          </div>
           <div class="text2">6. Users who achieve the goal of losing weight within the prescribed time can apply for compensation to the weight loss insurance, but it should be noted that within one month after the application of the claim, users still need to upload their weight and body fat percentage daily, to ensure that they are keeping a good body after achieving the goal.   At the end of the month, the user can receive a refund of the insurance amount and receive an additional bonus.
          </div>

        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <span class="title2">Tools and Technologies</span>
          <div class="text2">Weight loss insurance is considered to adopt HTML + Native hybrid technology for development.  During the development process, complete requirements document such as flow charts, sequence diagrams, and preparation will be less problems for subsequent development.  At the same time, we also need to conduct interaction design and UI design.  After designing the basic APP interaction diagram and prototype diagram, we will adjust the overall UI interface according to this part of the content.  We need to use Axure, Photoshop, Illustrator, and other software.  We also need to use Java language to develop the app, because weight loss insurance needs to use the server, we need Web services development languages such as PHP and JSP.
          </div>
        </div>
         <div class="section">
          <span class="title2">Skills Required</span>
          <div class="text2">1. We need to master advanced IT skills, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other front-end development abilities, and constantly debugging to achieve a satisfactory effect, so we also need to be proficient in Axure and other interactive tools or Photoshop using.
          </div>
           <div class="text2">2. Cross-platform capability should be satisfied, and cross-platform use should be achieved in IOS, Android, and other systems.
          </div>
           <div class="text2">3. We need JAVA for Android-based development or Objective-C for iOS-based development for back-end development.
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <span class="title2">Outcome</span>
          <div class="text2">If the project is successful, the results will affect the health level of the entire Australian people.    First, those who have been obese or overweight, will not be worried about potential diseases due to obesity after using weight-loss insurance and will have a healthier body.    For the whole of Australia, the ambiance of fitness will drive many people to join the active action of fitness.    The Australian government will no longer need to worry about the high number of obese or overweight people, and the image of Australians in the international community will be further improved.
